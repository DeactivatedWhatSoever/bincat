# Bincat
A minimal implementation of the Apache Tomcat

This repository is for software implementation skill advancements and to understand what a web server and a web container does in the Java world. 

## TODO List

1. Read the documentation of Tomcat on the apache website
2. Actually build the source code
3. Read the code line by line and try to draw a diagram of the classes and how they are architected
4. Write the code by just copying. Think while you copy. 
5. Write the essential code in this repository by not looking at the tomcat source
6. Build a really micro Java web container and try to make it fast as possible
